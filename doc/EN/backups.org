* Backup keys
As part of the Freedombone installation the GPG key used to encrypt backups will have been added to the /.gnupg/ keyring in your home directory. Ensure that you have a copy of all your keys by plugging in a LUKS encrypted USB drive and then running the commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh username@domainname -p 2222
#+END_SRC

Select /Administrator controls/ then /Backup and Restore/ then /Backup GPG key to USB drive (master keydrive)/.

Keep this USB drive in some safe place, since it will enable you to restore from previous backups.

A pro-tip for the best possible security is to create multiple USB drives containing key fragments (fragment keydrive), and then to distribute them amongst your friends. In the worst case just ask for the drives back and you'll be able to reconstruct the backup key. You can do this by selecting /fragment keydrive/ and then repeating the process with a number of different USB drives (typically 4 or more).
* Backup to USB
First and foremost - *encrypt your USB drives*! Even if you think you have "/nothing to hide/" if you accidentally lose a USB thumb drive (it's easy to lose small objects) and it's not encrypted then potentially someone might be able to obtain enough information about you to commit identity fraud, take out loans, open bank accounts, etc. Use LUKS encryption. In Ubuntu you can do this using the /Disk Utility/ application. Some instructions [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemsOnRemovableStorage][can be found here]].

Insert a USB thumb drive into the front socket of the Beaglebone Black.

Log into the system and become the root user, then run the /backup/ command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh username@domainname -p 2222
#+END_SRC

Select /Administrator controls/ then /Backup and Restore/ and then /Backup data to USB drive/.

Type in the LUKS password for the USB drive, then the backup will begin.

When the backup ends remove the USB drive and keep it somewhere safe. Even if it gets lost or falls into the wrong hands the content is encrypted and so is unlikely to become a source of leaks.
* Restore from USB
Log into the system and become the root user:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh username@domainname -p 2222
#+END_SRC

Select /Administrator controls/ then if this is a new Freedombone installation then you will first need to restore your backup keys. That can be done by selecting /Backup and Restore/ then /Restore GPG key from USB keydrive/. When that's done remove the keydrive and plug in the backup drive.

Select /Backup and Restore/ then /Restore data from USB drive/.

Enter the LUKS password for the USB drive. When the restore is complete you can remove the USB drive.
