This is a type of /followbot/ for the [[https://www.scuttlebutt.nz][Secure Scuttlebutt]] peer-to-peer messaging system. It's purpose is to follow your friends and keep a log of their messages so that if you are offline for a while when you return you can sync with this system to get all of the missed messages. This avoid the problem common in messaging systems of /everyone needing to be online all of the time/.

The Secure Scuttlebutt system has message encryption, but no protection of the metadata. It lives only on the clearnet. So this system is more about ensuring that messages get correctly delivered and appear in the right chronological order in unreliable situations where networks can be unreliable, rather than defending against surveillance adversaries.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys, space bar and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps*. If Vim is selected then you might want to unselect and uninstall it first, then select *scuttlebot*.

Install your favourite Scuttlebutt client onto your laptop, then select *Join Pub*. ssh into your Freedombone system and go to the *Administrator control panel* then select *App settings* followed by *scuttlebot*. You can then create an invite and paste it into your client.
