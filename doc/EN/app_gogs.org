Github is ok, but it's proprietary and funded by venture capital. If you been around on the internet for long enough then you know how this story eventually works itself out - i.e. badly for the users. It's really only a question of time. If you're a software developer or do things which involve the Git version control system then it's a good idea to become accustomed to hosting your own repositories, before the inevitable Github shitstorm occurs.

A Git hosting system called [[https://gogs.io][Gogs]] can optionally be installed. This is very similar to Github in appearance and use. It's lightweight and so well suited for use on low power ARM servers.

Navigate to your git site and click the *Register* button. The first user registered on the system becomes the administrator. Once you've done that then it's a good idea to disable further registrations. Currently that's a little complicated, but you can do it as follows:

#+begin_src bash :tangle no
sudo username@domainname -p 2222
#+end_src

Select *Administrator controls* then *App Settings* then *gogs*. You can then enable or disable registration of new users.

Disabling further registrations will stop any spam accounts being created by random strangers or bots.
