Pleroma is an OStatus and ActivityPub compatible social networking server, compatible with GNU Social, PostActiv and Mastodon. It is high-performance and so is especially well suited for running on low power single board computers without much RAM.

Some general advice about life in the fediverse [[./fediverse.html][can be found here]].

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys, space bar and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *pleroma*. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under *Dynamic DNS* on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "/quick cron example/" which appears after /update.php?/ and before />>/). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the [[./faq.html][FAQ]]. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as /pleroma.mydomainname.net/. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.

* Initial setup
The first thing you'll need to do is register a new account. You can set your profile details and profile image by selecting the small settings icon to the right of your name.

Once you have done that then you can disable further registrations from the *Administrator control panel* by going to *App Settings* then *pleroma* then *Disable new account registrations*. This may take a while because the app gets recompiled afterwards.

* Mastodon user interface
If you prefer a Tweetdeck-style user interface, similar to Mastodon, then once you have registered an account navigate to */yourpleromadomainname/web* and log in.

* Mobile apps
It's also possible to use Mastodon apps together with Pleroma, such as Tusky, since it supports the Mastodon API. You may need to install *IcecatMobile* and set it as your default browser (under *Settings/Apps/Menu*) in order for the initial oauth registration process to work.

The biggest hazard with Pleroma is that it's part of a public federated communications system. This means that conversations and replies from other servers may end up in your "whole known network" stream. The internet being what it is, some of these could be undesirable. You can block individual users or entire domains by going to the *Administrator control panel* and selecting *Domain or User Blocking*, then adding or removing entries. This blocks domains at the firewall level and also at the level of database and file storage.

If you want to block a particular user then select *Block a domain or user* and enter the user in the format *username@domaintoblock* (similar to an email address).
