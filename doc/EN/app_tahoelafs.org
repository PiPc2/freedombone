This is a robust system for encrypted file storage on one or more server. Files are accessed via a URL which contains the public key with which it was encrypted.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys, space bar and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *tahoelafs*. This system is entirely based upon use of onion addresses and so no other demaon names are needed.

* Initial setup
Get the login password for your Tahoe-LAFS system by going to *Passwords* on the *Administrator control panel* and selecting *tahoelafs*.

Go to the *About* screen on the *Administrator control panel* and look for the onion address for *tahoelafs* within the list of domains. Enter that into a Tor compatible browser. along with your username and the tahoelafs password. You can then use the interface to upload files and obtain URLs for them. The URL contains the public key needed to decrypt the file.

* Adding more servers
You can add more servers to the system to increase its storage capacity. In a typical Tahoe-LAFS new data storage servers are automatically discovered via an introducer node, but that creates a single centralised point of failure. The installation on Freedombone has no introducer node and so details for the servers of your friends need to be entered manually.

Other servers will typically be Freedombone systems with Tahoe-LAFS installed. Your Tahoe-LAFS server settings can be found on the *About* screen of the *Administrator control panel*. Use an end-to-end encrypted chat app to copy and paste those details and send them to other friends. To add the server details go to *App settings* on the *Administrator control panel* then select *tahoelafs* and *Add server*.
