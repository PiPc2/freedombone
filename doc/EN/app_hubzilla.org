Hubzilla is a web publishing and social network system which includes wiki, web pages, photo albums and file storage. It also has privacy controls which allow you to define who can see which content. It's possible to write posts and have them visible only to a group of friends (known as "/privacy groups/"), with the encryption being handled automatically.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys, space bar and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *hubzilla*. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under *Dynamic DNS* on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "/quick cron example/" which appears after /update.php?/ and before />>/). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the [[./faq.html][FAQ]]. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as /hub.mydomainname.net/. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.

After the install has completed go to *Security settings* and select *Create a new Let's Encrypt certificate* and enter the domain name that you are using for Hubzilla. If you're using the "onion only" version of the system then you don't need to do this. If the certificate is obtained successfully then you will see a congratulations message.


* Initial setup
If you have just obtained a Lets Encrypt certificate as above then go to *About* on the administrator control panel and you should see your Hubzilla domain listed there along with an onion address. You can then navigate to your site in a browser.

On first visiting your Hubzilla site you'll see the login screen. The first thing you need to do is *register* a new user. The first user on the system then becomes its administrator.
