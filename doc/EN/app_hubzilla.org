Hubzilla is a web publishing and social network system which includes wiki, web pages, photo albums and file storage. It also has privacy controls which allow you to define who can see which content. It's possible to write posts and have them visible only to a group of friends (known as "/privacy groups/"), with the encryption being handled automatically.

* Initial install
On first visiting your Hubzilla site you'll see the login screen. The first thing you need to do is *register* a new user. The first user on the system then becomes its administrator.
