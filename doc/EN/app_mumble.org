Mumble is a well known VoIP system originally used for gaming, but which works just as well for any general conference calls or meetings.

* Text chat
In addition to voice it is also possible to do text chat via mumble. The security of this is pretty good provided that you do it via Plumble and Orbot on mobile, but compared to other options such as XMPP/Conversations or Tox the security is not as good, since the mumble server currently doesn't support forward secrecy.

* Using with Ubuntu
Within the software center search for "mumble" and install the client then run it. Skip through the audio setup wizard.

Click on "add new" to add a new server and enter the default domain name for the Freedombone, your username (which can be anything) and the VoIP server password which can be found in the README file on the Freedombone. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate. You are now ready to chat.

* Using with Android
Install [[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid]]

If you don't have Orbot installed then enable The Guardian Project repository from the drop down menu and install it.

Search for and install Plumble.

Press the plus button to add a Mumble server.

Enter a label (which can be any name you choose for the server), the default domain name of the Freedombone or preferably the mumble onion address as shown on the *About* screen of the *Administrator control panel*, your username (which can also be anything) and the VoIP server password which can be found in the README file on the Freedombone.

Open the settings. Select General, then Connect via Tor. This will provide better protection, making it more difficult for adversaries to know who is talking to who.

Selecting the server by pressing on it then connects you to the server so that you can chat with other connected users.
