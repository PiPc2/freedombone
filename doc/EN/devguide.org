* Adding extra apps
Suppose you have some internet application which you want to add to the system. To do this you need to create an app script which tells the system how to install/remove and also backup/restore. The script should be designed to work with the current stable version of Debian.

On an installed system the app scripts go into the directory:

#+begin_src bash
/usr/share/freedombone/apps
#+end_src

and within the project repo they appear within the /src/ directory. Your new app script should have the name:

#+begin_src bash
freedombone-app-[myappname]
#+end_src

The /myappname/ value should not contain any spaces and will appear in the list of available apps.

An example template for an app script is shown below. Copy this and add whatever variables and configuration you need. Search and replace /myappname/ with your own.

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash

To test your app log into your system, select *Exit to command line* then gain root powers with:

#+begin_src bash
sudo su
#+end_src

Copy your app script to */usr/share/freedombone/apps/freedombone-app-myappname*.

And run the admin control panel:

#+begin_src bash
control
#+end_src

Select *Add/Remove Apps* and if all is well then you should see your app listed as installable. Test that installing and removing it works as expected.

Submit your working app to *https://github.com/bashrc/freedombone/issues*
