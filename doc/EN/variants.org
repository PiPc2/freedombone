Freedombone may be installed either in its entirety or as different variants with a more specialised purpose.  So for example if you just want to run a blog but don't care about any other services then you can do that. The following variants are available:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
 <center>
 <table style="width:80%; border:0">
  <tr>
    <td><center><b>Mailbox</b><br>An email server with GPG encryption and mailing list</center></td>
    <td><center><b>Cloud</b><br>Share files, maintain a calendar and collaborate on document editing</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><center><b>Social</b><br>Social networking with Hubzilla and GNU Social</center></td>
    <td><center><b>Media</b><br>Runs media services such as DLNA to play music or videos on your devices</center></td>

Non-mesh installs also come with an RSS reader which provides strong reading privacy on desktop and mobile via the use of a Tor onion service.
