Freedombone may be installed either in its entirety or as different variants with a more specialised purpose.  So for example if you just want to run a blog but don't care about any other services then you can do that. The following variants are available:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

 <table style="width:80%; border:0">
  <tr>
    <td><center><b>Mailbox</b><br>An email server with GPG encryption</center></td>
    <td><center><b>Cloud</b><br>Sync and share files. Never lose important files again</center></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><center><b>Social</b><br>Social networking with Hubzilla and GNU Social</center></td>

Non-mesh installs also come with an RSS reader which provides strong reading privacy on desktop and mobile via the use of a Tor onion service.
