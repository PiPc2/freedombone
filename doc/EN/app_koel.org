This enables you to store your music on the Freedombone server and then access it from any internet connected device. If you just want to make music accessible within your home network then [[./app_dlna.html][DLNA]] is usually sufficient, but if you want to be able to play your music from anywhere then Koel is a better option.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys, space bar and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *koel*. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under *Dynamic DNS* on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "/quick cron example/" which appears after /update.php?/ and before />>/). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the [[./faq.html][FAQ]]. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as /music.mydomainname.net/. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.

Go back to the *Administrator control panel*, select *Passwords* then *koel*. You can then use this password together with your email address to initially log in.

Once logged in go to settings and set the media path to */music*.
