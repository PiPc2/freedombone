* BabyBuddy

This app may be useful if you have a new child or babysitting duties. It helps caregivers track sleep, feedings, diaper changes, and tummy time to learn about and predict baby's needs without as much guess work.

This is certainly the type of data which you might want to keep private and away from companies who might otherwise use surveillance of parenting app data to try to guilt you into buying all sorts of junk that you don't really need or can't afford.
