"/With the increasing move of our computing to cloud infrastructures, we give up the control of our computing to the managers of those infrastructures. Our terminals (laptops, desktops) might now be running entirely on Free Software, but this is increasingly irrelevant given that most of what actually matters gets executed on a remote closed system that we donâ€™t control. The Free Software community needs to work to help users keep the control of all their computing, by developing suitable alternatives and facilitating their deployment./"

So you want to run your own internet services? Email, chat, VoIP, web sites, file synchronisation, wikis, blogs, social networks, media hosting, backups, VPN. Freedombone enables you to do all of that in a self-hosted way, where you keep control of your data and it resides in your own home.

[[./homeserver.html][Here's how]].

And here's how [[./beaglebone.html][on a Beaglebone Black]]. A list of other supported ARM boards [[./boards.html][can be found here]].

Or you can install [[./debianinstall.html][onto an existing Debian system]].

If you have a single board ARM computer which isn't one of the officially supported ones, such as Raspberry Pi, then you may still be able to install [[./armbian.html][Freedombone with Armbian]].

Want to make a community mesh network which can either be fully autonomous or connected to the internet? The [[./mesh.html][Freedombone Mesh]] is a wireless solution for networked communication that can be rapidly deployed in temporary, emergency or post-disaster situations where internet access is unavailable or compromised, or used as an infrastructural community service similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freifunk][Freifunk]].

After installation it's possible that you might want some advice on how to run your system and set up apps to work nicely with it.

If you find bugs, or want to add a new app to this system see the [[./devguide.html][Developers Guide]] and [[./codeofconduct.html][Code of Conduct]]. There is a Matrix chat room available at *#fbone:matrix.freedombone.net*.

Ready made disk images which can be copied onto USB or microSD drives are [[./downloads/current][available here]].
