So you want to run your own internet services? Email, chat, VoIP, web sites, file synchronisation, wikis, blogs, social networks, media hosting, backups, VPN. Freedombone is a home server system which enables you to self-host all of these things.

You can run Freedombone on an old laptop or a single board computer. See the [[./installmethods.html][list of installation methods]]. You can also use it to [[./mesh.html][set up a mesh network]] in your local area.

Check out the [[./apps.html][list of available apps]] and [[./faq.html][Frequently Asked Questions]] section. Recent developments are also described on [[https://blog.freedombone.net/tag/freedombone][the blog]].

Disk images which can be cloned straight to USB or microSD drives are [[./downloads/current][available here]].

If you find bugs, or want to add a new app to this system see the [[./devguide.html][Developers Guide]] and [[./codeofconduct.html][Code of Conduct]]. There is a Matrix chat room available at *#fbone:matrix.freedombone.net*.
