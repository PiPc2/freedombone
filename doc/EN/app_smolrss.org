* Smol RSS
This is an extremely simple RSS reader which is available only from an onion address, so that you have /the right to read/. There is very little code and so not much attack surface, and it will scale to screens of any size. This should be a better reading experience on mobile than with [[./app_ttrss.html][tt-rss]].

A disadvantage is that you can only add or remove feeds via the Freedombone administrator control panel, so this isn't suitable for multi-user environments. But once you have your feeds set up it's trivial to use, and unless you publish the onion address confidentiality should be maintained.

* Installation

ssh into the system with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh myusername@mydomain.com -p 2222
#+END_SRC

Select *Administrator controls* then *Add/Remove Apps* then *smolrss*.

After installation within *Administrator controls* go to *App settings* then *smolrss*. You can then add some feeds or edit the existing feed list. There are a few default feeds as an example.

Within *Administrator controls* go to *About this system* and select *smolrss*. You will then have the onion address. Navigate to your reader in a Tor compatible browser. You may need to allow the site within NoScript. Then select a feed from the list and begin reading. That's all there is to it.
