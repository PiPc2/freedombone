A social instance image allows you to easily set up a fediverse server, which federates using the OStatus or ActivityPub protocol. You will need:

 * An old laptop, capable of booting from USB
 * A USB drive, preferably Sandisk and 16GB or larger
 * An ethernet patch cable
 * A domain name of your own
 * A dynamic DNS account

The installation process is the same as usual, with the only difference being that on initial setup it will go straight to the domain setup details for your instance. In summary:

 * Copy the image to the USB drive, with the *dd* command or other image copying software
 * Connect the laptop to your internet router with the ethernet cable
 * Boot the laptop from the USB drive
 * Forward ports 80 and 443 from your internet router to the laptop
 * From another machine ssh into the laptop with *ssh fbone@freedombone.local -p 2222*
 * Follow the setup procedure and enter your domain name and dynamic DNS details
 * When installation is complete navigate to your domain and register a new user
