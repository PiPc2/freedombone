Freedombone is really just a couple of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash][bash]] scripts which install and configure software on a Debian GNU/Linux system. If you're a system administrator, software engineer or Linux hobbyist you'll probably be familiar with command line scripting and be able to make your own modifications or custom variants to suit your needs. Freedombone is licensed under the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html][GNU General Public License version 3]].

You can find the source code for this project [[https://github.com/bashrc/freedombone][on Github]].

Bugs or feature requests should be [[https://github.com/bashrc/freedombone/issues][entered here]].

*Why Github?*

Github is closed source. Sooner or later it will probably turn evil or become like Sourceforge - which in the distant past was also once the darling of open source developers but has long since fallen from grace. The biggest reason to use Github is just the number of eyeballs there and the easy discoverability of projects.

Longer term it is expected that the source code for this project will also be self-hosted, with Github acting only as a mirror to increase visibility.
