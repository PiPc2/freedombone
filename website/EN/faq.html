<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org41a3a27">
<p>
Yes. The minimum requirements are to have some hardware that you can install Debian onto and also that you have administrator access to your internet router so that you can forward ports to the system which has Freedombone installed.
</p>

<p>
The lack of a static IP address can be worked around by using a dynamic DNS service. Freedombone uses <a href="https://troglobit.com/inadyn.html">inadyn</a> , which supports a variety of dynamic DNS providers.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org89ba029">
<p>
When the project began in late 2013 the FreedomBox project seemed to be going nowhere, and was only designed to work with the DreamPlug hardware. There was some new hardware out - the Beaglebone Black - which could run Debian and was also a free hardware design so seemed more appropriate. Hence the name "Freedombone", being like FreedomBox but on a Beaglebone. There are some similarities and differences between the two projects:

<h2 id="org189b26f">Why not support building images for Raspberry Pi?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org189b26f">
<p>
The FreedomBox project supports Raspberry Pi builds, and the image build system for Freedombone is based on the same system. However, although the Raspberry Pi can run a version of Debian it requires a closed proprietary blob in order to boot the hardware. Who knows what that blob might contain or what exploits it could facilitate. From an adversarial point of view if you were trying to deliver "bulk equipment interference" then it doesn't get any better than piggybacking on something which has control of the boot process, and hence all subsequently run processes.
</p>

<p>
So although the Raspberry Pi is cheap and hugely popular it's not supported by the Freedombone project. Perhaps future versions of the Pi won't have the proprietary blob requirement, or maybe the blob will be open sourced at some stage.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org72837df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org72837df">Why use Tor? I've heard it's used by bad people</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org72837df">
<p>
Before you run screaming for the hills based upon whatever scare story you may have just read in the mainstream media there are a few things worthy of consideration. Tor is installed by default on Freedombone, <i>but not as a relay or exit node</i>. It's only used to provide onion addresses so that this gives you or the viewers of your sites some choice about how they access the information. It also allows you to subscribe to and read RSS feeds privately.
</p>

<p>
Onion routing - which is what Tor provides - gives you some level of protection against bulk surveillance of metadata. These days governments and other organisations are in the business of collecting and analysing your metadata. They want to have comprehensive lists of which sites you visited, or who visited your sites. Tor may at least partially help to thwart their totalitarian ambitions to know everything about everyone all of the time.
</p>

<p>
Tor is not a perfect system and is not fully decentralised. Like all software it has bugs, but it can be considered to probably be an effective tactic against some of the most egregious surveillance fanatics out there.
</p>

<p>
The media may also have sold you torrid tales about individual Tor project developers. While the conduct of individuals does matter, what matters far more is whether the technical system works and is practical for the average user. Don't allow your opinions of the technical system to be deflected by transient sex scandals or oppressive moralising, and <i>don't hold anyone to standards higher than you would apply to yourself</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org902dd8b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org902dd8b">How is Tor integrated with Freedombone?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org902dd8b">
<p>
Within this project Tor is used more to provide <i>accessibility</i> than the <i>anonymity</i> factor for which Tor is better known. The onion address system provides a way of being able to access sites even if you don't own a conventional domain name or don't have administrator access to your local internet router to be able to do port forwarding.
</p>

<p>
Tor is installed by default, but it's not configured as a relay or exit node. From the administrator control panel you can optionally set up a Tor bridge, but this is only for adverse situations and not usually advisable.
</p>

<p>
When you install an app you will be able to access it from its onion address.
</p>

<p>
Even if you're running the "onion only" build, this only means that sites are accessible via onion addresses. It doesn't mean that everything gets routed through Tor. If full anonymity is your aim then it's probably a good idea to just stick strictly to using TAILS.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb189ac7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb189ac7">Can I add a clearnet domain to an onion build?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb189ac7">
<p>
You could if you manually edited the relevant nginx configuration files and installed some dynamic DNS system yourself. If you already have sysadmin knowledge then that's probably not too hard. But the builds created with the <b>onion-addresses-only</b> option aren't really intended to support access via clearnet domains.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org25264af" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org25264af">Why use Github?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org25264af">
<p>
Github is paradoxically a centralized, closed and proprietary system which happens to mostly host free and open source projects. Up until now it has been relatively benign, but at some point in the name of "growth" it will likely start becoming more evil, or just become like SourceForge - which was also once much loved by FOSS developers, but turned into a den of malvertizing.
</p>

<p>
At present Github is useful just because of the sheer number of eyeballs and the easy discoverability of projects via search.
</p>

<p>
The source code for this project is experimentally independently hosted, and it is expected that in future the main development will shift over to an independent site, maybe with mirrors on Github if it still exists in a viable form.
</p>

<p>
Currently many of the repositories used for applications which are not yet packaged for Debian are on Github, and to provide some degree of resilliance against depending too much upon that it's possible to use <a href="./mirrors.html">mirrors stored on another server</a>.

Ordinarily this is good advice. However, the threat model for a device in your home is different from the one for a generic server in a massive warehouse. Compare and contrast:

<h2 id="org6c129a1">Why can't I access my .onion site with a Tor browser?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6c129a1">
<p>
Probably you need to add the site to the NoScript whitelist. Typically click/press on the noscript icon (or select from the menu on mobile) then select <i>whitelist</i> and add the site URL. You may also need to disable HTTPS Everywhere when using onion addresses, which don't use https.
</p>

<p>
Another factor to be aware of is that it can take a while for the onion address to become available within the Tor network. In tests the amount of time between creating a site and being able to access it's onion address seems to vary between a minute or two and half an hour. So don't be too impatient if the address doesn't appear to resolve straight away.

<h2 id="org77531ae">What is the best hardware to run this system on?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org77531ae">
<p>
It was originally designed to run on the Beaglebone Black, but that should be regarded as the most minimal system, because it's single core and has by today's standards a small amount of memory. Obviously the more powerful the hardware is the faster things like web pages (blog, social networking, etc) will be served but the more electricity such a system will require if you're running it 24/7. A good compromise between performance and energy consumption is something like an old netbook. The battery of an old netbook or laptop even gives you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS capability</a> to keep the system going during brief power outages or cable re-arrangements, and that means using full disk encryption on the server also becomes more practical.

<div id="outline-container-org7e1b9de" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7e1b9de">Can I add more users to the system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e1b9de">
<p>
Yes. Freedombone can support a small number of users, for a "<i>friends and family</i>" type of home installation. This gives them access to an email account, XMPP, SIP phone and the blog (depending on whether the variant which you installed includes those).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@mydomainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then <i>Manage Users</i> and then <i>Add a user</i>. You will be prompted for a username and you can also optionally provide their ssh public key.
</p>

<p>
Something to consider when having more than a single user on the system is the security situation. The original administrator user will have access to all of the data for other users (including their encryption keys), so if you do add extra users they need to have <b>complete trust</b> in the administrator.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that Freedombone installations are not intended to support many users (maybe ten at most). Large numbers of users may make the system unstable, and the more users you have on one system the more it becomes a single point of failure and also perhaps a honeypot from the standpoint of adversaries. Think of what happened with Lavabit and the moral dilemma which an administrator can be faced with (comply with threats and betray the trust of your users or don't comply and suffer other consequences). Ideally, you never want to put yourself into a situation where you can be forced to betray others.

<h2 id="org4425463">Why not use Signal for mobile chat?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4425463">
<p>
Celebrities recommend Signal. It's Free Software so it must be good, right?
</p>

<p>
If you are currently using a proprietary chat app, something without any encryption or something <i>really bad</i> such as Telegram, then Signal is definitely a step up in terms of security. But Signal has problems, which can be summarised as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>It uses phone numbers</b>. Phone numbers are used for Signal's initial verification, and they can of course be intercepted or faked. Plus it means that Open Whisper Systems keeps a list of phone numbers on its centralised server for its <i>"X has joined Signal"</i> notification. Even if they're hashed, they're still unique identifiers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> for the phone number system probably exist. Phone numbers are convenient for some users, but are also a non-trivial security risk. If you're using Signal then consider what it knows about who your contacts are, where that data is located and who else might have access to that.</li>
<li><b>It's based on a single server</b> run by Open Whisper Systems. That's a single point of failure and ought to be a big red flag (of the sporting rather than the socialist variety) as a possible locus for concentrated nefariousness.</li>
<li><b>It requires the installation of Google Play</b>. If you already have Google Play installed on a stock Android OS then this doesn't increase your security problems, but for other more secure Android variants it's a massive increase in attack surface.</li>
<li><b>It depends entirely upon the Google message pushing system</b>. That means that Google <i>at least knows who Signal messages are being sent to and may be able to infer the rest via your (insecure) Android phone contact list or via timing correlation of alternating deliveries</i>. Remember that for an adversary metadata in aggregate is much better than having the content of messages. At any time Google could decide that it doesn't want to support Signal, or in adverse circumstances they could be leaned upon by the usual agencies or government cronies.</li>
<li><b>Their privacy policy indicates that they will give whatever server data they have to third parties</b> under some conditions. Of course this is always claimed to be <i>for the very best of reasons</i> - such as combating fraud - but once that sort of disclosure capability exists it may be abused without you ever knowing about it.</li>
<li><b>Forking isn't really an option</b>. A fork was tried, but Moxie got annoyed when it still used his server. At the same time the level of interest in federating the server is not detectable with our best intrumentation, and is suspected to be negative. That's a catch 22 which effectively means that independent implementations of Signal will always leave some users unable to communicate with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To give credit where it's due Signal is good, but it could be a lot better. The real solution for private chat is to run your own XMPP server, as you can with Freedombone, or to have someone within your community do that. <i>There is no substitute for a decentralised solution which is within the control of your community</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga456b8e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga456b8e">What is the most secure chat app to use on mobile?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga456b8e">
<p>
On mobile there are various options. The apps which are likely to be most secure are ones which have end-to-end encryption enabled by default and which can also be onion routed via Orbot. End-to-end encryption secures the content of the message and onion routing obscures the metadata, making it hard for a passive adversary to know who is communicating with who.
</p>

<p>
The current safest way to chat is to use <a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a> together with <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">Orbot</a> - both of which can be installed from <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-droid</a>. You may need to enable the <a href="https://guardianproject.info/">Guardian Project</a> repository within F-droid in order to be able to install Orbot. Within the settings of the Conversations app you can set it to route via Tor, and also you can use the XMPP service of your Freedombone server. That way all of the software infrastructure is controlled by you or your community.
</p>

<p>
There are many <a href="#org4425463">other fashionable chat apps</a> with end-to-end security, but often they are closed source, have a single central server or can't be onion routed. It's also important to remember that closed source chat apps should be assumed to be untrustworthy, since their security cannot be independently verified.

<div class="org-src-container">

<h2 id="org9081cf6">Why is logging for web sites turned off by default?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9081cf6">
<p>
If you're making profits out of the logs by running large server warehouses and then data mining what users click on - as is the business model of well known internet companies - then logging everything makes total sense. However, if you're running a home server then logging really only makes sense if you're trying to diagnose some specific problem with the system, and outside of that context logging everything becomes more of a liability than an asset.
</p>

<p>
Logs can potentially become quite large and frequent logging isn't a great idea if you're running on a flash disk since it just increases the wear rate and thus shortens its usable lifetime. Also from a security perspective if a compromise occurs then the attacker gets considerably less social information if there are no logs containing timestamped IP addresses.
</p>

<p>
On the Freedombone system web logs containing IP addresses are turned off by default. They're not deleted, they're just never created in the first place. If you need to turn logging on in order to fix a problem then go to the <b>Administrator control panel</b> and enable logging. If you don't manually turn it off again then it will turn itself off automatically at the next system update, which is typically a few days away.

<p>
Even when using Freedombone metadata analysis by third parties is still possible. This can be mitigated by accessing your blog, or other web services, via their <i>onion addresses</i>, rather than via more conventional domain names. In that case your ISP and any government which they might be compelled to report back to will know when your system is being accessed, but not necessarily <i>which</i> services are being accessed <i>or by whom</i>. So for instance using a Tor browser and the onion address people may be able to safely read your blog or wiki and be reasonably confident that metadata isn't being gathered about what they read (or more concisely the metadata which can be gathered by a third party may just not be very useful or personally identifiable). On the other hand if you access the system via conventional domain names and dynamic DNS then it's safe to assume that metadata can and will be collected by third parties.

<h2 id="orgdc3df60">Why does my email keep getting rejected as spam by Gmail/etc?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdc3df60">
<p>
Welcome to the world of email. Email is really the archetypal decentralized service, developed during the early days of the internet. In principle anyone can run an email server, and that's exactly what you're doing with Freedombone. Email is very useful, but it has a big problem, and that's that the protocols are totally insecure. That made it easy for spammers to do their thing, and in response highly elaborate spam filtering and blocking systems were developed. Chances are that your emails are being blocked in this way. Sometimes the blocking is so indisciminate that entire countries are excluded. What can you do about it? Unless you control the block list at the receiving end you may not be able to do much unless you can find an email proxy server which is trusted by the receiving server.
</p>

<p>
Often ISPs will run their own SMTP mail server which you can use for proxying, typically called <i>mail.ISPdomain</i>. On the administrator control panel there is an option to set the details for outgoing email from the Mutt client.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@mydomainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then <b>Outgoing Email Proxy</b> and enter the details for your ISP SMTP server.
</p>

<p>
This may work, at least when using Mutt, and admittedly if it does then it's a compromise in which you are using some infrastructure which is not controlled by the community - with all of the usual hazards which go along with that.
</p>

<p>
The current arrangement with email blocking works well for the big internet companies because it effectively centralises email to a few well-known brand names and keeps any independent servers out, or creates dependencies like the one just described in which you become a second class citizen of the internet.
</p>

<p>
So the situation with email presently is pretty bad, and there's a clear selection pressure against decentralization and towards only a few companies controlling all email services. Longer term the solution is to have more secure protocols which make spamming hard or expensive.
