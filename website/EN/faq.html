Yes. You might want to change the branding and the upstream repo. The only requirement is that you abide by the terms of the AGPL license. Free Software is about freedom, not price, so there's nothing stopping you from charging for it. For further information see the <a href="./support.html">contact details</a>.

<h2 id="sec-4">I don't have a static IP address. Can I still install this system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Yes. The minimum requirements are to have some hardware that you can install Debian onto and also that you have administrator access to your internet router so that you can forward ports to the system which has Freedombone installed.
</p>

<p>
The lack of a static IP address can be worked around by using a dynamic DNS service. Freedombone uses <a href="https://troglobit.com/inadyn.html">inadyn</a> , which supports a variety of dynamic DNS providers.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">What are the best microSD cards to use?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
There can be big differences in the performance of microSD cards, and the cheaper ones are almost invariably terrible and/or unusable. Sandisk and Samsung currently appear to be the better brands. You can find some performance benchmarks <a href="http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/microsd-cards">here</a>. However, benchmarks like this only give a very rough idea of performance and they can vary significantly between individual cards even within the same brand.
</p>

<p>
If you're struggling to get good performance out of your microSD card then you might want to consider running from a SATA drive or SSD instead. Some boards such as Cubieboard and Olinuxino have SATA sockets such that you can connect an SSD. It doesn't have to be high cost and the smallest SSD you can find will probably be enough. It's then possible to build an image with the <b>&#x2013;sata</b> option or download one of the pre-built ones and copy it both to the microSD and SATA drive. SSD drives can give a 10x performance improvement over just using a microSD card.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">On a single board computer can I boot from an external SSD or hard drive?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Some single board computers, such as Cubieboards or OLinuxino, have a SATA socket on them which enables an external drive to be connected. This is usually intended for extra file storage, but it is also possible to run the operating system from an external drive. This can have the advantage of significantly increasing the read/write performance and your apps will appear to run more quickly.
</p>

<p>
Typically a microSD read speed is 10-30MB/s. An SSD or hard drive can be 100MB/s or more, so that's a big potential gain.
</p>

<p>
Single board computers usually don't have the capability of booting directly from an external drive, but what you can do is boot from a partition on a microSD drive, which then runs the main filesystem (the rootfs) from the external drive.
</p>

<p>
To create an image suitable for running from an SSD or hard drive use the &#x2013;sata option, such as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">freedombone-image -t cubieboard2 --sata sda2
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that the sata option should be set to point to the second partition on the drive, which is normally sda2.
</p>

<p>
When the image is created then use the dd command to copy it both to a microSD card and to the SSD or hard drive. Plug them both into the board and it should then boot and use the external drive.

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Why Freedombone and not FreedomBox?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
When the project began in late 2013 the FreedomBox project seemed to be going nowhere, and was only designed to work with the DreamPlug hardware. There was some new hardware out - the Beaglebone Black - which could run Debian and was also a free hardware design so seemed more appropriate. Hence the name "Freedombone", being like FreedomBox but on a Beaglebone. There are some similarities and differences between the two projects:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Why not support building images for Raspberry Pi?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
The FreedomBox project supports Raspberry Pi builds, and the image build system for Freedombone is based on the same system. However, although the Raspberry Pi can run a version of Debian it requires a closed proprietary blob in order to boot the hardware. Who knows what that blob might contain or what exploits it could facilitate. From an adversarial point of view if you were trying to deliver "bulk equipment interference" then it doesn't get any better than piggybacking on something which has control of the boot process, and hence all subsequently run processes.
</p>

<p>
So although the Raspberry Pi is cheap and hugely popular it's not supported by the Freedombone project. Perhaps future versions of the Pi won't have the proprietary blob requirement, or maybe the blob will be open sourced at some stage.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">Why use Tor? I've heard it's used by bad people</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Years ago Tor was usually depicted in the mainstream media as something scary inhabited by cyberterrorists and other bad cybers, but today to a large extent Tor is accepted as just another way of routing data in a network. Depending upon where you live there may still be some amount of fearmongering about Tor, but it now seems clear that the trajectory is towards general acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Tor and its onion addresses, previously called hidden addresses, have a few key advantages:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NAT traversal
</li>
<li>Firewall traversal
</li>
<li>Avoiding the domain name system (DNS), which is mostly centralized and not secure
</li>
<li>Avoiding passive bulk surveillance in which governments try to find out who is communicating with who
</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the negative side it's a complex system which is not fully decentralized.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10">How is Tor integrated with Freedombone?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
Within this project Tor is used more to provide <i>accessibility</i> than the <i>anonymity</i> factor for which Tor is better known. The onion address system provides a way of being able to access sites even if you don't own a conventional domain name or don't have administrator access to your local internet router to be able to do port forwarding.
</p>

<p>
Tor is installed by default, but it's not configured as a relay or exit node. From the administrator control panel you can optionally set up a Tor bridge, but this is only for adverse situations and not usually advisable.
</p>

<p>
When you install an app you will be able to access it from its onion address.
</p>

<p>
Even if you're running the "onion only" build, this only means that sites are accessible via onion addresses. It doesn't mean that everything gets routed through Tor. If full anonymity is your aim then it's probably a good idea to just stick strictly to using TAILS.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">Can I add a clearnet domain to an onion build?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
You could if you manually edited the relevant nginx configuration files and installed some dynamic DNS system yourself. If you already have sysadmin knowledge then that's probably not too hard. But the builds created with the <b>onion-addresses-only</b> option aren't really intended to support access via clearnet domains.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-12">What are the data protection implications of running this system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
Data protection laws such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> in the EU or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998">Data Protection Act</a> in the UK usually only apply to formal organizations which are recognized as being legal entities. So you have to be running a business or a charity or some other formal organization in order for the storage of what's known as <i>personally identifying information</i> to potentially become a legal issue. Laws like this usually include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A right to obtain your information
</li>
<li>A right to be forgotten (i.e. to have your data permanently deleted)
</li>
<li>Ensuring that stored personal data remains accurate
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you're self-hosting then in the language of data protection law the "<i>data controller</i>" and the "<i>data subject</i>" are one and the same, so there isn't any power differential of that sort. Freedombone is only intended for small numbers of users, so if you are hosting more than one person chances are that you know the others quite well and can arrange to update their data or delete their account if that's needed. Even if data protection laws are later extended to include home server type scenarios it's unlikely that this will become a problem.
</p>

<p>
For the mesh version similar applies. Each peer stores their own personal data and it never gets aggregated and stored in any centralized way.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-13" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-13">After using nmap or other scanning tool I can no longer log in</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
This system tries to block port scanners. Any other system trying to scan for open ports will have their IP address added to a temporary block list for 24 hours.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-14" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-14">Should I upload my GPG keys to keybase.io?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
It's not recommended unless there exists some compelling reason for you to be on there. That site asks users to upload the <b>private keys</b>, and even if the keys are client side encrypted with a passphrase there's always the chance that there will be a data leak in future and letter agencies will then have a full time opportunity to crack the passphrases.
</p>

<p>
Saying something resembling "<i>only noobs will use crackable private key passphrases</i>" isn't good enough. A passphrase should not be considered to be a substitute for a private key.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-15" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-15">Keys and emails should not be stored on servers. Why do you do that?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<p>
Ordinarily this is good advice. However, the threat model for a device in your home is different from the one for a generic server in a massive warehouse. Compare and contrast:

<p>
In the home environment a box with a good firewall and no GUI components installed may be much more secure than the end points, such as laptops and phones.

<div id="outline-container-sec-16" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-16">Why can't I access my .onion site with a Tor browser?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-16">
<p>
Probably you need to add the site to the NoScript whitelist. Typically click/press on the noscript icon (or select from the menu on mobile) then select <i>whitelist</i> and add the site URL. You may also need to disable HTTPS Everywhere when using onion addresses, which don't use https.
</p>

<p>
Another factor to be aware of is that it can take a while for the onion address to become available within the Tor network. In tests the amount of time between creating a site and being able to access it's onion address seems to vary between a minute or two and half an hour. So don't be too impatient if the address doesn't appear to resolve straight away.

<h2 id="sec-17">What is the best hardware to run this system on?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-17">
<p>
It was originally designed to run on the Beaglebone Black, but that should be regarded as the most minimal system, because it's single core and has by today's standards a small amount of memory. Obviously the more powerful the hardware is the faster things like web pages (blog, social networking, etc) will be served but the more electricity such a system will require if you're running it 24/7. A good compromise between performance and energy consumption is something like an old netbook. The battery of an old netbook or laptop even gives you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS capability</a> to keep the system going during brief power outages or cable re-arrangements, and that means using full disk encryption on the server also becomes more practical.
</p>

<p>
<i>Out of fashion</i> but still working computer hardware tends to be cheap and readily available, yet still good for providing internet services.

<div id="outline-container-sec-18" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-18">Can I add more users to the system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-18">
<p>
Yes. Freedombone can support a small number of users, for a "<i>friends and family</i>" type of home installation. This gives them access to an email account, XMPP, VoIP, NextCloud and possibly other apps which have been installed.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@mydomainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then <i>Manage Users</i> and then <i>Add a user</i>. You will be prompted for a username and you can also optionally provide their ssh public key.
</p>

<p>
Something to consider when having more than a single user on the system is the security situation. The original administrator user will have access to all of the data for other users (including their encryption keys), so if you do add extra users they need to have <b>complete trust</b> in the administrator.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that Freedombone installations are not intended to support many users (maybe ten at most). Large numbers of users may make the system unstable, and the more users you have on one system the more it becomes a single point of failure and also perhaps a honeypot from the standpoint of adversaries. Think of what happened with Lavabit and the moral dilemma which an administrator can be faced with (comply with threats and betray the trust of your users or don't comply and suffer other consequences). Ideally, you never want to put yourself into a situation where you can be forced to betray others.

<h2 id="sec-19">Why not use Signal for mobile chat?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-19">
<p>
Celebrities recommend Signal. It's Free Software so it must be good, right?
</p>

<p>
If you are currently using a proprietary chat app, something without any encryption or something <i>really bad</i> such as Telegram, then Signal is definitely a step up in terms of security. But Signal has problems, which can be summarised as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>It uses phone numbers</b>. Phone numbers are used for Signal's initial verification, and they can of course be intercepted or faked. Plus it means that Open Whisper Systems keeps a list of phone numbers on its centralised server for its /"X has joined Signal"/ notification. Even if they're hashed, they're still unique identifiers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> for the phone number system probably exist. Phone numbers are convenient for some users, but are also a non-trivial security risk. If you're using Signal then consider what it knows about who your contacts are, where that data is located and who else might have access to that. Consider what might happen if an adversary gets to know your mobile number.
</li>
<li><b>It's based on a single server</b> run by Open Whisper Systems. That's a single point of failure and ought to be a big red flag (of the sporting rather than the socialist variety) as a possible locus for concentrated nefariousness.
</li>
<li><b>It requires the installation of Google Play</b>. If you already have Google Play installed on a stock Android OS then this doesn't increase your security problems, but for other more secure Android variants it's a massive increase in attack surface. There is a separate apk available for download, but it won't receive updates and the hash shown on the site often doesn't match.
</li>
<li><b>It depends entirely upon the Google message pushing system</b>. That means that Google <i>at least knows who Signal messages are being sent to and may be able to infer the rest via your (insecure) Android phone contact list or via timing correlation of alternating deliveries</i>. Remember that for an adversary metadata in aggregate is much better than having the content of messages. At any time Google could decide that it doesn't want to support Signal, or in adverse circumstances they could be leaned upon by the usual agencies or government cronies.
</li>
<li><b>Their privacy policy indicates that they will give whatever server data they have to third parties</b> under some conditions. Of course this is always claimed to be <i>for the very best of reasons</i> - such as combating fraud - but once that sort of disclosure capability exists it may be abused without you ever knowing about it. Consider how difficult, or not, it may be for a government to reverse engineer a database of hashed telephone numbers.
</li>
<li><b>Forking isn't really an option</b>. A fork was tried, but Moxie got annoyed when it still used his server. At the same time the level of interest in federating the server is not detectable with our best intrumentation, and is suspected to be negative. That's a catch 22 which effectively means that independent implementations of Signal will always leave some users unable to communicate with each other.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To give credit where it's due Signal is good, but it could be a lot better. The real solution for private chat is to run your own XMPP server, as you can with Freedombone, or to have someone within your community do that. <i>There is no substitute for a decentralised solution which is within the control of your community</i>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-20" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-20">What is the most secure chat app to use on mobile?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-20">
<p>
On mobile there are various options. The apps which are likely to be most secure are ones which have end-to-end encryption enabled by default and which can also be onion routed via Orbot. End-to-end encryption secures the content of the message and onion routing obscures the metadata, making it hard for a passive adversary to know who is communicating with who.
</p>

<p>
The current safest way to chat is to use <a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a> together with <a href="https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/">Orbot</a> - both of which can be installed from <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-droid</a>. You may need to enable the <a href="https://guardianproject.info/">Guardian Project</a> repository within F-droid in order to be able to install Orbot. Within the settings of the Conversations app you can set it to route via Tor, and also you can use the XMPP service of your Freedombone server. That way all of the software infrastructure is controlled by you or your community.
</p>

<p>
There are many <a href="#sec-19">other fashionable chat apps</a> with end-to-end security, but often they are closed source, have a single central server or can't be onion routed. It's also important to remember that closed source chat apps should be assumed to be untrustworthy, since their security cannot be independently verified.

<p>
To remove a user:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@mydomainname -p 2222

<h2 id="sec-22">Why is logging for web sites turned off by default?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-22">
<p>
If you're making profits out of the logs by running large server warehouses and then data mining what users click on - as is the business model of well known internet companies - then logging everything makes total sense. However, if you're running a home server then logging really only makes sense if you're trying to diagnose some specific problem with the system, and outside of that context logging everything becomes more of a liability than an asset.
</p>

<p>
Logs can potentially become quite large and frequent logging isn't a great idea if you're running on a flash disk since it just increases the wear rate and thus shortens its usable lifetime. Also from a security perspective if a compromise occurs then the attacker gets considerably less social information if there are no logs containing timestamped IP addresses.
</p>

<p>
On the Freedombone system web logs containing IP addresses are turned off by default. They're not deleted, they're just never created in the first place. If you need to turn logging on in order to fix a problem then go to the <b>Administrator control panel</b> and enable logging. If you don't manually turn it off again then it will turn itself off automatically at the next system update, which is typically a few days away.

<p>
Even when using Freedombone metadata analysis by third parties is still possible. This can be mitigated by accessing your blog, or other web services, via their <i>onion addresses</i>, rather than via more conventional domain names. In that case your ISP and any government which they might be compelled to report back to will know when your system is being accessed, but not necessarily <i>which</i> services are being accessed <i>or by whom</i>. So for instance using a Tor browser and the onion address people may be able to safely read your blog or wiki and be reasonably confident that metadata isn't being gathered about what they read (or more concisely the metadata which can be gathered by a third party may just not be very useful or personally identifiable). On the other hand if you access the system via conventional domain names and dynamic DNS then it's safe to assume that metadata can and will be collected by third parties.

Spamassassin is also available and within Mutt you can use the S (shift+s) key to mark an email as spam or the H (shift+h) key to mark an email as not being spam. So by using a combination of email rules and spam filtering you should be able to avoid any spammers or trolls.

<h2 id="sec-32">Why does my email keep getting rejected as spam by Gmail/etc?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-32">
<p>
Welcome to the world of email. Email is really the archetypal decentralized service, developed during the early days of the internet. In principle anyone can run an email server, and that's exactly what you're doing with Freedombone. Email is very useful, but it has a big problem, and that's that the protocols are totally insecure. That made it easy for spammers to do their thing, and in response highly elaborate spam filtering and blocking systems were developed. Chances are that your emails are being blocked in this way. Sometimes the blocking is so indisciminate that entire countries are excluded. What can you do about it? Unless you control the block list at the receiving end you may not be able to do much unless you can find an email proxy server which is trusted by the receiving server.
</p>

<p>
Often ISPs will run their own SMTP mail server which you can use for proxying, typically called <i>mail.ISPdomain</i>. On the administrator control panel there is an option to set the details for outgoing email from the Mutt client.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">ssh username@mydomainname -p 2222
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Select <i>Administrator controls</i> then <b>Outgoing Email Proxy</b> and enter the details for your ISP SMTP server.
</p>

<p>
This may work, at least when using Mutt, and admittedly if it does then it's a compromise in which you are using some infrastructure which is not controlled by the community - with all of the usual hazards which go along with that.
</p>

<p>
The current arrangement with email blocking works well for the big internet companies because it effectively centralises email to a few well-known brand names and keeps any independent servers out, or creates dependencies like the one just described in which you become a second class citizen of the internet.
</p>

<p>
So the situation with email presently is pretty bad, and there's a clear selection pressure against decentralization and towards only a few companies controlling all email services. Longer term the solution is to have more secure protocols which make spamming hard or expensive.

If you can find some details for an obfs4 Tor bridge (its IP address, port number and key or nickname) then you can set up the system to use it to connect to the Tor network. Unlike relay nodes the IP addresses for bridges are not public information and so can't be easily known and added to block lists by authoritarian regimes or over-zealous ISPs.

ssh into your Freedombone system, go to the <b>administrator control panel</b>, select <b>security settings</b> then <b>Tor Bridges</b> and <b>Add a bridge</b>. You can then enter the details.
